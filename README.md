# Real-Time-Clock




This code is fairly simple and takes little to no knowledge of computer science. The languages used in the process of creating this code are css, js, and html. If you choose to source or copy this code into your own website, please give the user'savit' credit in any shape or form, whether that be in tiny text in the bottom right, etc. If you have any suggestions on how I can improve this code shoot me a message on discord(savit#0001) or twitter(@falsemute). For any inquires email me at savitkrishnaps@gmail.com.
